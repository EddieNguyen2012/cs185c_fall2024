# Impact of Southeast Asian Monsoons and La Nina/El Nino on Ocean Stratification and Circulation using MITgcm

The goal of this project is to model and analyze the impact of the Southeast Asian monsoon system 
(both the Southwest and Northeast monsoons) together with El Nino/La Nina on ocean stratification and circulation patterns,
particularly in the South China Sea and adjacent regions.

## Project Description
How do seasonal monsoons in southeast Asia impact ocean stratification?

In this project, my region of interest will be from 99-122E and 2-25N, which includes South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand. My model will
run with the duration of 1 year but two times: one simulate the year with El Nino and another during La Nina year. Specifically, I will use ECCO Version 5 2015
data to simulate the El Nino model as this is one of the strongest El Nino events in
recent years. Then the La Nina after that in 2017 will be chosen for the other model. I expect the El Nino model to have
weaker trade wind, higher temperature and lower salinity due to the effect of the event. 

As of right now, I expect to create a timeseries model to represent the output temperature and salinity from both models then comparing
them to see the difference between the 2 models. I want to investigate seasonal variations in ocean stratification, particularly
changes in temperature and salinity profiles. Then, Analyze the differences in vertical temperature and salinity profiles between the El Nino
conditions in 2015 and the La Nina conditions in 2017, focusing on changes in stratification and mixed layer depth during each monsoon season.
