# California Upwelling

This modeling project is an example to demonstrate the approximate scope, files, and organization of a class project for 185C.

## Project Description
In this project, I will investigate the effects of coastal wind on upwelling in California. I will run my model simulation for one year in two experiments: a run with wind and a run without wind. I will form my experiment during the year 2008 which is a year of strong upwelling as shown in the [BEUTI Index](https://ecowatch.noaa.gov/thematic/upwelling).
