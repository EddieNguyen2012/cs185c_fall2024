# CS 185C Fall 2024

Welcome to my ocean modeling repository! This repo is designed to be an example for the CS 185C course taught at San Jos√© State University in Fall 2024.

There are two key directories in this repository: the homework directory for storing, managing, and turning ing weekly homework assignments, and a project directory for storing files for the final projectin this course. The project directory will not be created until week 8 although it is displayed here as sneak peek on what's to come.
